# WebFramework
Basic Website UI automation framework based on Page Object Model and TestNG.

Its currently in an infant stage.  I will add actual page objects and write real test scripts that navigate wikipedia and does asserts for things of interest.
This repo is for experimentation.  I am an android SDET trying to branch my knowledge out a bit.
